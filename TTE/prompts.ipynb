    "This Markdown file provides a behind-the-scenes look at the **prompts** that guided the step-by-step creation of our Target Trial Emulation (TTE) code. Each prompt addressed a specific portion of the analysis, making it easier to structure, write, and refine the notebook (`TTE_Converted_Annotated.ipynb`).\n",

    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- Ensured that the dataset was inspected for missing values, coded consistently, and loaded correctly into Python.  \n",

    "> “We need a discrete-time survival structure. How do we transform each subject’s data into multiple rows—one for each period of follow-up—until the event or censoring occurs?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- Discrete-time hazard models require the data in a person-period format so each row represents a specific time interval for a single individual.  \n",
    "- Ensures that `period` (or `followup_time`) reflects a consistent time variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Code Snippets:**  \n",
    "- A loop or `groupby` approach that iterates over each individual’s total follow-up time, appending rows up to the time of event or censoring.  \n",

    "> “For an alternative perspective, how do we compute and plot Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment arm—both in ITT and PP frameworks?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- Kaplan-Meier curves provide an intuitive picture of survival over time, complementing the logistic approach.  \n",
    "- Created separate subsets for “treated” vs. “control,” then fit `lifelines` `KaplanMeierFitter` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Code Snippets:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Subsetting data via `expanded_data_itt[expanded_data_itt['assigned_treatment'] == 1]`.  \n",

    "> “How do we directly visualize the difference in survival between treatment and control arms at each time point?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- A difference curve highlights the absolute gap in survival probabilities (Treated minus Control).  \n",
    "- Optionally attempted naive confidence intervals (though full Greenwood-based estimates are more appropriate for formal inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Code Snippets:**  \n",
    "- `survival_treated - survival_control` to get the difference at each time.  \n",
    "- Simple standard error approach (though noted as approximate).  \n",
    "- `plt.plot(...)` calls with 95% CI lines.\n",

    "**Prompt:**  \n",
    "> “Can we further explore patient-level heterogeneity via clustering (e.g., K-Means) on baseline covariates before analysis?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- Investigating potential subgroups or baseline patterns to see if there's effect modification or if certain clusters have distinct risk profiles.  \n",
    "- Required scikit-learn imports (`StandardScaler`, `KMeans`), plus data standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Code Snippets:**  \n",
    "- `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler` and `from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`.  \n",

    "\t•\tMore complex weighting, which means weights could be extreme → needs winsorization.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### are there any errors in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**  \n",
    "- Improve interpretability for anyone reading the code or results.  \n",
    "- Ensured consistent variable naming and thorough docstrings or markdown cells describing each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resulting Actions:**  \n",
    "- Adding code comments to highlight logic.  \n",
    "- Setting readable axis labels and figure titles.  \n",
    "- Summarizing results at the end with short conclusions.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Each major code segment in **`TTE_Converted_Annotated.ipynb`** was born from these targeted prompts, ensuring that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data was structured correctly for discrete-time survival and Kaplan-Meier methods.  \n",
    "- Both Per-Protocol and Intention-to-Treat analyses were handled consistently.  \n",
    "- Additional exploratory methods like clustering were integrated smoothly.  \n",
    "- The final product is organized and annotated, reflecting each prompt’s objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stepwise prompting method offers a **clear blueprint** for anyone looking to emulate a clinical trial using observational data in Python. By posing concise, direct questions, we were able to systematically build robust code that adheres to the principles of **Target Trial Emulation**.\n"
